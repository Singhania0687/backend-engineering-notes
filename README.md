# Backend Engineering Notes

This repository contains my hands-on backend engineering practice including:

- Bash scripts used in real backend workflows
- Docker & Docker Compose setups
- <a href="https://github.com/Singhania0687/backend-engineering-notes/blob/main/backend-engineering-notes/linux/Basic_commands.md">Linux command usage and internals</a>
- Redis, MongoDB, SQL fundamentals
- Networking and system design concepts

All content here is practiced, tested, and used alongside my backend projects.
